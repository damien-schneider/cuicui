				<h3>What are Bézier curves used for?</h3>
				<p>
					Bézier curves are used to create smooth animations and transitions in
					web development. They are defined by four points: two anchor points
					and two control points. The anchor points define the start and end
					points of the curve, while the control points determine the shape of
					the curve. Bézier curves are commonly used in CSS animations and
					transitions to create effects such as easing in and out, linear
					transitions, and custom timing functions.
